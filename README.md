# üé¨ Netflix Clone Backend

A backend system for a Netflix-like video streaming platform built using **Spring Boot microservices** architecture.  
This project incorporates **JWT-based authentication**, **Razorpay payment integration**, and **Apache Kafka** for event-driven communication.  
All microservices are **containerized using Docker** and **orchestrated with Kubernetes** to ensure scalability, reliability, and easy deployment.
